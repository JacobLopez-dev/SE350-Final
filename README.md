# SE350-Final
This is my final Prject for SE 350 Object Oriented Software Development. A pirate ship game in which Columbus (The player) is tasked with 
traversing a grid in search of hidden treasure. However, look out for Pirates and other dangers at sea. This project used several 
design patterns including Strategy, Singleton, and Observer. Additionally, it uses defferent Algorithms for the pirate ships that are 
in search of columbus.
